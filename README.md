## ðŸ›’ Project Introduction â€” Sales Data Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a retail sales dataset using **Python**. The main objective is to identify **who spends more money** on shopping, with a focus on key customer attributes such as:

* **Gender**
* **Age Group**
* **State**
* **Occupation**
* **Product Category**
* **Marital Status**

The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract actionable insights. Using libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`, the analysis uncovers patterns in consumer behaviorâ€”helping understand which demographics contribute the most to overall sales.

This project is ideal for beginners in data analytics or businesses aiming to segment their customers for targeted marketing and better decision-making.
